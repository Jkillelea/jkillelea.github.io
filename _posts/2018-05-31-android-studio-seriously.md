A quick note on Android Studio. Like most Google applications these days, it expects you to have a good high speed internet connection at all times. Sure. I guess. In this instance I do. I've got plenty of RAM and cable internet. Gripes about that aside, my real complaint is that Google won't even use my full bandwidth! Come on, at least have the decency to give me full 8 MBps speed, like I'm paying for! 2 MBps in the dead of night kinda hurts.
